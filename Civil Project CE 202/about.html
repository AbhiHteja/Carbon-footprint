            <p class="favourite-place-card-description">
              It is well known that vehicle emissions play a substantial role in global carbon emissions. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that in 2019, transportation was responsible for around 24% of all energy-related carbon dioxide emissions worldwide.

              By reducing the number of vehicles on the road and, consequently, the amount of fuel spent, vehicle pooling, commonly referred to as carpooling, can assist in reducing carbon emissions. The precise emissions reduction will depend on a number of variables, including the number of passengers sharing a car, the distance traveled, and the vehicle's fuel efficiency.

              Vehicle pooling, or carpooling, can bring several benefits to the global transport sector, including Reduced traffic congestion, particularly in urban areas.

            <p class="favourite-place-card-description">
              By sharing vehicles, one of the main causes of climate change can be lessened. Carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced. By encouraging the use of low-emission vehicles like electric, hybrid, or more fuel-efficient cars, carpooling can reduce emissions. Carpooling can contribute to further reductions in carbon dioxide emissions by promoting the use of these vehicles.
             In general, carpooling has the potential to greatly cut carbon dioxide emissions from transportation, which is one of the important sectors where emissions reduction is required to alleviate the effects of climate change

            <p class="favourite-place-card-description">
              By lowering the number of vehicles on the road and, consequently, the amount of fuel used, vehicle pooling can considerably lower carbon emissions. Carpooling enables people to split the expense of transportation, which can assist in lowering total transportation costs for both individuals and businesses. Less traffic means less demand for parking spaces, which can assist in relieving parking congestion in urban areas.
